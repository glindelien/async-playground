PLAN TO REFACTOR APP COMPONENT

Move methods and associated logic into separate files

App should render:
- Title
- AddLocation
- AirQualityView

Refactor out the logic from App's addLocation method and move it into the AddLocation component.

handleInputChange can be moved out of App and into AddLocation - mabye use hooks?

AirQualityCard could perhaps be refactored to be a functional component using hooks to keep track of whether the delete button appears or not.
