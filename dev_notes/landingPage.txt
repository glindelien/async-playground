- Concept 3 -
// Line break slides in like a loading bar
// Each character of the title fades in, one after the other
// Tagline fades in towards the end

** Note: This concept might be the easiest/fastest to implement for MVP

- Landing Page Concept -

// On page load, the user sees an animation
// The Awaire title fades in
// Simultaneously, small circles slide/fade in from the left & right sides symmetrically
// The tagline fades in
// The circles fade out

- Concept 2 -
// Small circles drop down from top of page, ending just above where the title is displayed
// Earlier circles fade out while newer ones fade in, so only 2-3 display at a time
// When the circles reach the title, the title fades in
// Tagline fades in almost immediately after (or starting during the title fade-in)
