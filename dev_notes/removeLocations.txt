UPDATE 1/13/2021 11:59PM PT

// Finished implementation of removeLocation method. Next up: add button & styling for user interface improvements.

UPDATE 1/13/2021 4:30PM PT

// Implemented ability to extract zip code from element that was clicked. Added pseudocode for next steps for logic in removeLocation method. Feature is 75% complete in functionality, but some frontend styling and additions are still needed.

UPDATE 1/13/2021 3:30PM PT

// Upon further investigation, note that the zip code is already stored with the other AQI data in State. No need to refactor to ensure this data is accessible.

// Implemented a skeleton for the removeLocation method in App. This method is passed down in props from App >> AirQualityView >> AirQualityCard. Initially, it is set to console log a message when the location name is clicked.

UPDATE 1/12/2021 2:15PM PT

Steps 1 + 2 from previous update are complete.
Remaining:

1. Refactor to store zip code when adding locations
2. Implement filtering function to remove by zip code

UPDATE 1/10/2021 6:45pm PT

1) Enable locations to persist in localStorage
2) Add ability to clear localStorage
3) Refactor to store zip code when adding locations
4) Implement filtering function to remove by zip code

UPDATE 1/9/2021 12:30pm PT

- How do we implement a feature that allows users to remove locations they added previously? -

- USER FEATURES -
// Each AirQualityCard component will need to have an "X" button that indicates it can be deleted from AirQualityView
// Enable auto-saving a user's locations to their localStorage
// Add button or clickable text below AirQualityView that will enable the user to clear their own localStorage (resets the App)

- REFACTOR -
// Currently, when a zip code is submitted the API returns an array with the data. That data does not include the actual zip code, so we need to reattach it.
// Instead of updating the state with just the array of AQI data, transform the data into an object.
// That object will include two properties: one for the zip code (to identify it) and one for the array of associated AQI data

- IMPLEMENTATION -
// When a user clicks the remove/delete button on an AirQualityCard, this should trigger a filtering method that will filter out that location and reset State with remaining locations
// Iterate through the current array of locations in state, when you find the zip code associated with the location to remove, remove it (could use splice or filter)
