aqi needs to become an array (representing locations) of arrays (representing AQI data for 1 location)
addLocation needs to update state with the above in mind (pushing instead of replacing)
Likely will be able to remove "location" property from state
AirQualityView will be rendered in App (in place of AirQualityCard)
AirQualityView will take in the aqi array from state
  map through AQI array ((location) => {})
    render AirQualityCard for each location
    pass the current location (array) in as a prop

AirQualityCard will need to be refactored
takes in location (array) as a prop
remove locationJSX variable
rename indexCardJSX variable to airQualityCardJSX
if block should check for the length of AQI array being greater than 0
  map through location
    render Location component with location data passed in
    render IndexCard component with the current data object passed in
