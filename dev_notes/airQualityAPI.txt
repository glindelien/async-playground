UPDATE 12/7/2020 3:00PM PT
Another required change to AQ API choice. AirVisual does not provide PM2.5 data on the free tier, which is an essential piece of data for our users.

Now switching to investigate the AirNow API

UPDATE 12/7/2020 2:50PM PT
Have made significant progress investigating how to interact with AQ API using Postman.

Here is the endpoint for fetching air quality data by specified city:

http://api.airvisual.com/v2/city?city=Los Angeles&state=California&country=USA&key={INSERT API KEY}

API Key can be found when logging in here:

UPDATE 12/7/2020 2:40PM PT
Air Quality API is expensive ($400-500/month) in order to interact with it. Pivoting to IQ Air's AirVisual API instead.

Potential Air Quality APIs to use:

Air Quality API seems like the winner since it also includes the ability to fetch historical data, in addition to current (realtime) air quality data and forecasted data. All of these data points may be useful for the target audience.

NOTE: Both require latitude and longitude as parameters in order to retrieve air quality data from the API.
