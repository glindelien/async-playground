The Air Quality API requires latitude and longitude as parameters to retrive air quality data from the API.

Google has a promising Geocoding API that looks like it could be a good option for converting user inputted zip codes to lat/lon coordinates.

UPDATE 12/7/2020 2:50PM PT
After pivoting to use the IQAir AirVisual API for the AQ API for this project, it seems geocoding may no longer be needed. We can specify a city/country instead as parameters. These notes are closed for now.
