Potential Air Quality APIs to use:

Air Quality API seems like the winner since it also includes the ability to fetch historical data, in addition to current (realtime) air quality data and forecasted data. All of these data points may be useful for the target audience.

NOTE: Both require latitude and longitude as parameters in order to retrieve air quality data from the API.
